 The best enhancement to the Sitecore Admin (XP) for Content Editors & Marketers

## Description
MLBox - extension for Marketing Automation

The project is to enable the marketer to determine:
- Users with low engagement
- Users with high engagement
- Predict the churn customer

and add these user segments to the marketing plan for further interaction

For the demonstration, we use the historical data that we took from this link:

[Dataset]([https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail)

In order for the data to be up-to-date, we shifted the dates so that they were for 2020-2021 (a total of 541,909 records)
